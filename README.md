Submarine Shooter

This is a 2D arcade shooter built in java.


The goal is to survive survive and to defeat the most amount of enemies possible.
At first, there's only one enemy type that randomly circulates around the screen. But, as the player
kills more enemies the second type will spawn - this stalks the player until they reach them. 
Enemies will have a chance of dropping items which the player can use to upgrade their shooting speed 
and movement, as well as to replenish health.
